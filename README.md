# Home Assistant Web App


## Thesis Summary
This thesis focuses on the development of a web application for data visualization in the
context of a smart home. The purpose of the application is to provide users with insights
into sensor data and enable them to control devices connected to the Home Assistant
platform, which is used for home automation. The thesis is structured into three parts. The
first part provides an introduction to the concept of a smart home and the Internet of
Things (IoT). The second part focuses on the Home Assistant platform and the React
JavaScript library, which will be used in the implementation of the application. The third
part describes the implementation of the web application using React, provides a detailed
explanation of the architecture and features of the application, and emphasizes the
importance of leveraging cutting-edge technologies in the IoT domain. Through a realworld case study, the proposed solution will be tested and its practical application in the
context of a smart home will be demonstrated. The goal of this thesis is to create a
functional and user-friendly web application that enhances the user experience in a smart
home environment
